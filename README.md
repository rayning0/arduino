Today (July 17, 2013) I worked with my landlord's cheeky 12-year-old son to make this Arduino music project (http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Tone3). See our video!

We made a simple musical keyboard with 2 force sensing resistors. They make music when pressed. See how much of a joker he is? Hahaha!

Simple keyboard using the tone() function: This example shows how to use the tone() command to generate different pitches depending on which sensor is pressed.

In the video, he says our project "sounds like a chipmunk on coke."

June 7, 2013:

I've been playing with my new Arduino (http://arduino.cc/) microcontroller! See this cool YouTube video I just posted about my cool project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps2LAIPHVIM

It combines Arduino with an LED, speaker, light sensor, and potentiometer.

When the external light on the sensor drops, both the LED starts blinking faster AND the speaker makes a sound at a higher frequency! When the external light gets brighter, the LED blinks more slowly and speaker drops to a lower pitch.

Turning the potentiometer adjusts the speaker volume.

Here's my Arduino code to control this: https://github.com/rayning0/arduino/blob/master/LED_speaker_photosensor/LED_speaker_photosensor.ino

To make this, I modified the circuit and code from Chapter 1 of the excellent "Arduino Cookbook," (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802486.do) by Michael Margolis.

I use the Ultimate Arduino Microcontroller Pack: http://www.makershed.com/Ultimate_Arduino_Microcontroller_Pack_p/msump1.htm

For complete Arduino beginners, please look at these fantastic slides by Tod Kurt. He taught these four 3-hour classes on Arduino. His slides are not only easy to understand, but he gives clearer and more practical information than many books. He teaches you how to build many cool little projects: http://todbot.com/blog/bionicarduino/

What a fantastic way to learn electronics, step-by-step, and to use software to control hardware! For you Ruby folks, here's a nice tutorial on using Ruby to program Arduino, using a gem called Dino: http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/arduino/introducing_arduino.html

You don't need Ruby, though. The Arduino language is a simplified version of C/C++. It's easy to learn and user-friendly. 

This week, I was teaching my landlord's 12-year-old son how to use Arduino, and he was hypnotized. He kept yelling, "This is SOOO COOOL! Mooooom, please buy me one!"
